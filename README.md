Description:
This project aims to explore the simplicity and efficiency of Morse code decoding, comparing its effectiveness in recovering corrupted data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Morse code, with its distinct representation of characters through dots and dashes, has been a cornerstone in communication systems for centuries. This project delves into understanding Morse code's robustness in data recovery and its potential applications in modern communication technologies.

Features:

Morse code decoding algorithm implementation.
Comparison with NLP techniques for data recovery from corrupted Morse code transmissions.
Visualization of Morse code patterns and decoded messages.
Integration with existing communication systems or devices.
Goals:

Investigate the efficiency of Morse code in transmitting and recovering data.
Provide insights into the applicability of Morse code in modern communication technologies.
Develop a versatile Morse code decoding tool for educational and practical purposes.
Contributions:
Contributions are welcome from enthusiasts and researchers interested in Morse code, signal processing, and communication systems. Whether it's improving decoding algorithms, optimizing data recovery techniques, or enhancing visualization features, every contribution adds value to the project.
